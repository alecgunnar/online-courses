# This driver will expect the student to upload
# a file called `hist_plot_generator.r`.
#
# This command will open an R session, and supply
# the student's submission via an input redirection.

# NOTE: if you expect the student to upload a ZIP
# archive, you must unzip it first, like so:
# unzip archive.zip

R --no-save --no-restore < hist_plot_generator.r

# At this point, you may evaluate the results from
# the above command however you'd like.

# To provide a grade as feedback, use something like
# the following to print the necessary YAML:

touch $1
echo "---" > $1
echo "pass: 10" >> $1
echo "fail: 10" >> $1
echo "comments: |" >> $1
echo "             10 tests passed" >> $1
echo "             10 tests failed" >> $1
