# Future Improvements

Here are a few ideas regarding possible future improvements and features.

## Automated Plagiarism Detection

Take a look into [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/).

## Administration Panel

This functionaly prooved too much to implement in release one, but is certainly a needed feature. It would ideally provide interfaces and functionality for instructors to veiw and manage all of their courses. They could delete, modify, or copy them.

## Provide Support for More Languages

Take a look at [Supporting More Languages](supporting-more-languages.md) to see how to add languages to the application.

## Live Coding

Wouldn't it be neat if a programming test/exam tested your programming abilities live? Sure it would! Take a look at [Compile Box](https://github.com/remoteinterview/compilebox) to see something like what is being reffered to here.
